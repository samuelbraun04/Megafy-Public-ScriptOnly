# Megafy

### STATUS:

*Currently, megafyUserInteractive.py is the only functional version of Megafy â€“ however, it is quite inefficient at the moment.*

*Co-development of a Megafy webtool (w/ [Noah Do Rego](https://github.com/NoahdoRegoUO)) is underway to allow for simpler access to Megafy's functionality. The webtool is being made using React and Django (Python). NOTE: The webtool's development has come to a temporary halt due to a few miscalculations on my part, and will continue once mine and Mr. Do Rego's academic lives allow for more free-time; a Megafy webtool will one day soon come to fruition.*

### DESCRIPTION:

Megafy allows you to quickly customize audio files by:
- Bass boosting (use with soft clipping for distortion!)
- Altering audio speed (slowing or speeding up)
- Pitch shifting (lowering or raising pitch)
- Adding reverb
And more to come!

### FAQ:

- Customizing can be done using presets (user-made or prebuilt!) or altering each parameter value seperately.

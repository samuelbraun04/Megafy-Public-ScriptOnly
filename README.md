# Megafy

### STATUS:

*Currently, megafyUserInteractive.py is the only functional version of Megafy.*

*Megafy is currently functional but inefficient. The script is in continuous development.*

*Currently co-developing a Megafy webtool (w/ [Noah Do Rego](https://github.com/NoahdoRegoUO)) to allow for simpler access to Megafy's functionality. Webtool is being made using React and Django (Python).*

### DESCRIPTION:

Megafy allows you to quickly customize audio files by:
- Bass boosting (use with soft clipping for distortion!)
- Altering audio speed (slowing or speeding up)
- Pitch shifting (lowering or raising pitch)
- Adding reverb
And more to come!

### FAQ:

- Customizing can be done using presets (user-made or prebuilt!) or altering each parameter value seperately.
